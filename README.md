# MyMQTTApp
This app is for my [ myMQTTDrawer project ](https://github.com/vashukashyap/myMQTTDrawer).  This app suscribe to broker and receive Drawer status and give the notification.




## Building app

### Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

 ( only for android, you can try to run it on ios but i am not sure weather it will work or not ).
